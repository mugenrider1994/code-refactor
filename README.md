# challenge1-html


## Description

My motivation for this project was to expand my skillset for HTML and CSS. I built this project to display my skills and capabilities of debugging and enhancing the html and CSS in the code provided. This has allowed me to make sure the website looks clean and professional. I learned a lot about semantic elements and the importance of committing and pushing your code as you make changes.
